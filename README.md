# Guitar Hero AI

This project is a bot that can play Clone Hero, which is a game that emulates Guitar Hero for PC.

It's a python script that takes screenshots, isolates the colored keys and if a key appears it presses a button to hit such key.

The YouTube video for this project is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s01cpIl9gaA) and it also has a video of it playing Through The Fire And Flames available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFh2n7a4SoM).
